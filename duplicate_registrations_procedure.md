# Procedure to resolve duplicate IGSN registrations

## Accidental multiple IGSN registrations for the same sample
### Example

A user brings a sample to a lab for analysis without knowing that the sample is already identified by an IGSN.
The lab assigns a new IGSN, based on the assumption that no prior registration exists.

### Procedure

Already existing IGSN registrations must be respected to maintain an unambiguous identification of a sample. 
The second registration 

## Subsample taken outside of the home institution

### Example

Cores and/or subsamples are shipped to other institutions for additional scans, detailed analyses, and subsampling/splitting.

### Procedure

## Samples are moved from one institution (or allocating agent) to another (change of curating institution)

### Example

A sample is moved from Repository A, served by IGSN Agent 1, to Repository B, served by Agent 2.

### Procedure

The ability of an Agent to mint IGSN is limited to its designated namespaces.
